<h2 id="introduction">Asked questions, answered!!!</h2>

<h2>Why do you like deltarune so much?</h2>
<p>Ok so first off,</p>
<a href="https://deltarune.com/">play the game</a>
<p>Secondly, the reason I like deltarune is that it is very unique,</p>
<p>it has a good story,</p>
<p>good characters and GREAT chapter endings!</p>
<h2>What's with all of your controversies?</h2>
<p>Depends on what one you're talking about, of course.</p>
<p>I have been in a lot of controversy, but there is one I have always been trying to clear up.</p>
<p>I'm not a groomer lol</p>
<p>I know why people think that but it's not true, if it was I would be in prison right now.</p>
<p>It's just some thing a guy who I broke up with made up because he was probably mad or something.</p>
<p>Moving on,</p>
<h2>What's your stance on the Russia Ukraine stuff?</h2>
<p>It has nothing to do with me to be honest, but...</p>
<p>I'm completely neutral on the war, I just don't want people to fight.</p>
<h2>Why did you make Vyond Remastered?</h2>
<p>I'll be honest, I wanted to make something different</p>
<p>I have seen all of these lvm clones but not many people revived the vyond lvm.</p>
<p>So, I got to learning JavaScript and decided to give it my all, it certainly worked out!</p>
<p>Because now I have a basically finished project that I'm really proud of.</p>
<h2>HoW DiD yOu GeT bUsSiNeSs FrIeNdlY oN cRaPpEr LiNe?2?2?2?2?</h2>
<p>I'm fed up with this question, so I'll only give you a partial answer.</p>
<p>1.4.0 of wrapper offline, get it if you want that theme.</p>
<h2>And that's the end!</h2>
